QUESTIONS

1. What is a hash table?
Answer: A type of data structure that stores each value by linking it a key, forming key-value pairs. It is similar to Javascript objects.

2. What is hashing?
Answer: Hashing is when a string converts to a numerical index

3. How does a hash table store data?
Answer: A hashing function converts the key to a hash code.  The hash code then get stored in a hash table.  It then distributes entities (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array.  Each element is assigned a key.  By using that key the hash function computes an index that suggest where an entry can be found or inserted

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
Answer: Hash tables and objects are similar.  The difference is that objects should be used in data structure when the data is a static number of distinct values of different types.  Hash tables on the other hand is used when data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
      -A list of pets and their unique names. Answer: Hash Table
      -The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. Answer: Object
      -The name and location of every company in a given city. Answer: Hash Table
      -All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. Answer: Hash Table
      -The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. Answer: Object

6.Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
Answer:
function createCustomerInfo(name, address, phoneNumber){
  CREATE HashMapName
  CREATE HashMapAddress
  CREATE HashMapPhoneNumber
  STORE phoneNumber (key) with name and address (values)
}

function lookupCustomer(phoneNumber) {
  IF customer does NOT have phoneNumber
    PRINT "New customer needs to be created"
  ELSE IF customer has phoneNumber
    RETURN customer information
  ELSE customer phoneNumber doesn't match
    PRINT "Customer info does not exist"
  END IF
}

7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
Answer:
function createInventory(itemName, itemId, quanitity) {
  CREATE HashMapInventory
  STORE itemId (key) in HashMapInventory with itemName and quantity (values)
}

function checkInventory(itemId) {
  IF itemId is in HashMapInventory
    RETURN itemName and quanitity
  ELSE
    PRINT "This item does not exist"
  END IF
}

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
function createDigitalNewspaper(publisher, publicationDate) {
  CREATE HashMapNewspaper
  STORE publicationDate (key) with publisher (value) in HashMapNewspaper
}

function searchNewspaper(publicationDate) {
  IF publicationDate is in HashMapNewspaper
    RETURN publicationDate and publisher
  ELSE
    PRINT publicationDate 'was not found'
  END IF
}
