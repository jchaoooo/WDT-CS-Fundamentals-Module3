Short Answer
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
Answer:  Looking for a specific piece of clothing in a pile of clothes.  You would go through each clothing item individually until you found the one you're looking for.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
Answer: Looking for a word in the dictionary. You open the dictionary and see if the word you're looking for is before or after the page you're on.  Once you get to the correct letter section the word starts with you determine whether the word is before or after the one you look at.  You continually divide and conquer until the word is found.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
Answer: 7

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
Answer: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Answer: Linear search because since the collection is unsorted we cannot divide and conquer using binary search.  Linear search for this would be best.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Answer:  Binary search because since the items are sorted we can divide and conquer and quickly remove groups of items rather than looking at each item individually.

Programming Assignment:
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
Answer:
function findWord(collection, word) {
  let low = 0;
  let high = collection.length - 1
  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.round((low + high) / 2)
    if (collection[mid] > word) {
      high = mid - 1
    } else if (collection[mid] < word) {
      low = mid + 1
    } else {
      return word + " is in index " + mid
    }
  }
  return word + " is not in the list"
}

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
Answer:
function findFish(collection, fish) {
  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
    if (collection[i] === fish) {
      return "You've net the " + fish + " in the tank!"
    }
  }
  return "Sorry, you couldn't find the " + fish
}
