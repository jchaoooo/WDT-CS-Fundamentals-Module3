QUESTIONS

1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
ANSWER:  Stacks implement a LIFO priority collection where queues implement a FIFO priority.

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
ANSWER: They are both data structures used to prioritize entries.  Both stacks and queues have functions to add an entry to the "list" as well as deleting it.  The difference is one removes the element from the front and the other removes it from the end.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?
ANSWER: I would use stacks for UNDO because when you undo something you want to remove the most recent operation, thus have a last come first out priority.  Where REDO is the opposite of UNDO.  We would use queues for REDO since it has a first in first out priority.

Programming Questions
You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

4.Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".
ANSWER:
FUNCTION reverse(string)
  INIT split String to array named reversedLetters
  INIT empty Array reversedWord
  FOR each character in reversedLetters starting from end of Array
    PUSH character to reversedWord
  END FOR
  RETURN reversedWord.join
END FUNCTION

function reverse(string) {
  let reversedLetters = string.split("");
  let reversedWord = [];
  for (let i = reversedLetters.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversedWord.push(reversedLetters[i])
  }
 return reversedWord.join("")
}

5. Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
   INIT empty Arrays newQueue and deletedItem
   FOR each character in queue
    IF last item in queue
      PUSH to itemToDelete
    ELSE
      PUSH to newQueue
    END IF
  END FOR
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS


6. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   PUSH element to Array
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   SHIFT array
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
